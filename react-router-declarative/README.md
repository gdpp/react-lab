# React Router Devalrative with ShadCN and TailwindCSS

This section is completely optional, but highly recommended. Here we begin building the project that will be used to learn React Router fundamentals.

Additionally, weâ€™ll integrate the following tools into the project:

- **ShadCN UI**
- **TailwindCSS**

By doing so, you'll not only learn routing concepts but also apply them in a styled and component-rich environment.

## Covered Topics

1. **React Router Basics**

   - Route definitions
   - Nested routes (Parent and Child)
   - Route components and structure
   - `Outlet` for nested rendering
   - URL segmentation
   - `useParams` to extract route parameters
   - Route parameters handling
   - Manual navigation with `useNavigate`
   - Declarative navigation with `Link` and `NavLink`
   - Route-based component rendering

2. **Advanced Features**

   - Code splitting with `React.lazy`
   - Suspense for fallback UI
   - Optimizing loading behavior
   - Organizing routes for scalability

3. **Styling & Components**
   - Integrating TailwindCSS for utility-first styling
   - Using ShadCN components for clean UI
   - Combining routing and layout with consistent design

## What I Learned

In this section, I started working on a project that will serve as the foundation for learning React Router. I explored the core concepts of client-side routing in React, including how to define routes, nest them, and dynamically render components using `Outlet`. I also learned how to extract and use URL parameters with `useParams`, how to navigate manually or declaratively, and how to split routes efficiently using `React.lazy` and `Suspense`. Additionally, I integrated TailwindCSS for styling and used ShadCN UI components to build a modern, maintainable interface that works seamlessly with routing. These tools together enhanced my understanding of React Router and how to build scalable, well-structured frontend applications.
