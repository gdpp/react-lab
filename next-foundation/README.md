# Next.js foundation

This project is a practical introduction to the core foundations of Next.js, designed to help you understand how the framework works from the ground up and how to build modern, production-ready web applications.

Rather than focusing on isolated features, this repository provides a structured path through routing, layouts, data handling, and backend capabilities, giving you a complete mental model of Next.js.
